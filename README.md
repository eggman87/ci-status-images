# Continuous Integration Status Images

*Test coverage percentage and other useful status images for continuous integration systems.*

## Overview

A collection of useful status images in several different themes and variations. Each theme provides images for *passing*, *failing* and *unknown* build states,
as well as images for test coverage in increments of 5%, and an *unknown* variant.

Please feel free to use these images in your own projects as you see fit.
